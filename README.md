### Discord Bot
Discord API: [https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo](bwmarrin/discordgo)
MySQL Drivers: [https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql](my-sql-driver/mysql)

This is my first attempt at the Go/Golang and also writing a Discord Bot. It requires both of the above projects.
This wouldn't have been possible for me to do without contributors of the projects above, so I greatly appreciate their work.
